# Third Challenge
Congratulations ⚔️, you're now the hero of the Customer Success Team and other developer
because of your excellent testing chops. 🙌

The dashboard is function just fine but with so many people applying for funds, it's getting a little slow to load all of the records in each time. The Customer Success Manager comes to you and asks if there's anything that can be done to speed it up. You both decide that adding pagination to the table/API should do the trick.
